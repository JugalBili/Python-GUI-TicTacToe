## Description
This program is a simple Tic Tac Toe game made using the Tkinter Python toolkit. 
There are two game modes which are included, Player vs Bot, and Player vs Player. 

**Player vs Bot:**
Go against the computer, which randomly choses a box to place their O inside. The goal is to get three X's in a row before the computer gets three O's in a row. 

**Player vs Player:**
Play with yourself or your friends where Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O. The goal is to get three X's in a row before the opponent gets three O's in a row. 

The title screen below is the screen which appears when the program is first run. <br />
